This handles the documentation content for JointsWP.com. It is synced to the website using the [WordPress GitHub Sync Plugin](https://github.com/mAAdhaTTah/wordpress-github-sync). If a page needs to be added, it must first be added to WordPress - simply create a new issue asking for the page to be created. 

## Contributing 
To contribute to the documentation, simply fork the repository and submit pull requests. When a pull request is accepted, it is synced to JointsWP.com. Contributors for the documentation is by far one of the most needed pieces of the project.
