One of the greatest assets to JointsWP is the community that has built up around it. Whether it was by submitting a pull request on GitHub or sharing the project on Twitter, users from all over the world have contributed in some fashion.

However, up until this point, there hasn't been a recommended way to make feature requests or discuss upcoming changes  - I'm going to fix that.

<!--more-->

There will now be a <a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A&quot;feedback+wanted&quot;" target="_blank">"feedback wanted" label</a> on GitHub that will be used as a way to discuss potential changes to the theme. There are already two great threads awaiting community feedback:
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP/issues/175">Is it time to remove some rarely used functions &amp; files?</a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP/issues/171">Should functions files be moved to an 'includes' directory?</a></li>
</ul>
I want to encourage all users to get involved on those threads - as those threads are going to help shape the future of the theme.
