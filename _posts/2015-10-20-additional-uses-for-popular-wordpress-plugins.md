<h3>Yoast SEO for Better Social Sharing</h3>
With over 1-million active installs, Yoast SEO is known as the go-to SEO plugin for WordPress developers. However, Yoast also has a <a href="http://kb.yoast.com/article/219-getting-open-graph-for-your-articles" target="_blank">powerful set of social media sharing tools</a> that allow your posts to look great when shared on social networks like Facebook, Twitter and Google+.

When you activate these features, the Yoast SEO plugin will automatically insert the proper meta tags into your websites HEAD to ensure your posts are optimized for Facebook OpenGraph and Twitter Cards.
<h3>Yoast SEO for Breadcrumb Navigation</h3>
With a <a href="http://kb.yoast.com/article/245-implement-wordpress-seo-breadcrumbs" target="_blank">couple of clicks and a few lines of code</a>, you can quickly add a breadcrumb navigation to your WordPress site without needing to install an additional plugin.

<h3>Redirection for Outbound Link Tracking and Link Masking/Shortening</h3>
The Redirection plugin by John Godley (an Automattic employee) makes it really easy to setup 301 redirects after moving a website or changing domains. But it is also a great tool for tracking outbound link clicks and "masking" those outbound links.

Instead of having to remember a long affiliate link, you can setup a simple redirect such as YourDomain.com/Affiliate. And whenever someone clicks that link, it will show up in your Redirects Panel as a "hit" - allowing you to easily see which affiliate links are getting the most clicks.

While there are other ways to achieve this, your most likely already using this plugin anyway, so why not get some extra use out of it?

<h3>Gravity Forms for Basically Anything</h3>
For a long time, I couldn't understand all the hype over Gravity Forms. There are numerous free contact form plugins that are pretty good, however, after using Gravity Forms I can't imagine using any other form plugin.

Beyond creating awesome forms, Gravity Forms has multiple add-ons that truly make it the utility knife of form plugins. This year alone I have used Gravity Forms to create a donation form, an event sign-up form, a survey, capture emails and even used it to create a form to allow users to submit posts/content from the front-end of a website.
