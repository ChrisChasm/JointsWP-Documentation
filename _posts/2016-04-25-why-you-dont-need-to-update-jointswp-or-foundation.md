As WordPress users, we've been trained to keep all components of our WordPress install - plugins, themes, core, etc - completely up-to-date to avoid security issues. In fact, the number one question I get about JointsWP is: <strong><em>how do I update JointsWP and/or Foundation?</em></strong>

Here's the answer: <strong>you shouldn't.</strong>

<!--more-->
<h2>The Case for Not Updating</h2>
JointsWP is meant to be the foundation (pun not intended) of your WordPress theme. If you were building a house, JointsWP would be the bricks and wood that hold the house together. If a new type of brick came out, would you completely tear down your house just to use the new type of brick? Highly unlikely.

When starting a new project, you should always use the most up to date version of JointsWP and Foundation. However, when working on existing projects, <strong>there is absolutely no need to update</strong>. Unlike WordPress and WordPress plugins, there is no security threat to running older versions.

I have many, many websites that are running Foundation 5 using older versions of JointsWP. These websites will never see updated versions of JointsWP/Foundation unless they are completely rebuilt.

<em><strong>Clarification Note: </strong><a href="http://jointswp.com/docs/updating-foundation/">Updating Foundation</a> is extremely easy in JointsWP and you should totally do it if you are experiencing Foundation related bugs. However, migrating a website between major versions (for example from Foundation 5 to Foundation 6) is not recommended. </em>

Build on.
