Right on the heels of yesterday's release that <a href="http://jointswp.com/jointswp-now-supports-browsersync-and-source-maps/">added Browsersync and Source Maps</a>, JointsWP now includes <a href="http://zurb.com/article/1427/foundation-for-sites-6-2-leading-the-way-">Foundation 6.2</a>. The new release fixes many issues, including many of the bugs that plagued the navigation menus since the 6.0 release.

This was a fairly large update that included updating all of the JS components to ES2015 and the creation of customizable color palettes (seriously, check these out - cool stuff!). For a full list of what's changed, be sure to check out the <a href="https://github.com/zurb/foundation-sites/releases">6.2 release on GitHub</a>.
