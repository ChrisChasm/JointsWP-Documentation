In Foundation 6, the way we use media queries in our Sass files has changed just a bit compared to <a href="http://jointswp.com/using-foundation-media-queries-with-sass/" target="_blank">how things were done in Foundation 5</a>. We now have the ability to use theÂ <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/media-queries.html" target="_blank">breakpoint() mixin</a>, which makes using media queries with Sass even easier.

For example, this Scss file:

[css]

.widget {
  padding: 0 5px;
  h1 {
    color: red;
    @include breakpoint(medium) {
      color: green;
    }
    @include breakpoint(large) {
      color: blue;
    }
  }
}

[/css]

compiles into CSS as:

[css]
.widget {
  padding: 0 5px;
}

.widget h1 {
  color: red;
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 40em) {
 .widget h1 {
   color: green;
 }
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 64em) {
 .widget h1 {
   color: blue;
 }
}
[/css]
