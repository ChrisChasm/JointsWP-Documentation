<h4>Is JointsWP child theme friendly?</h4>
Yes and no.

Many developers have setup JointsWP to be used with a child theme, however, it is not the recommended way of using the theme. It requires a lot of work to keep a theme "child theme friendly" and often hinders development.

So while you are free to use the theme in any way you want, I highly recommend making all changes directly to the theme. Make it yours. That way you aren't dependent on what changes I may, or may not, make.

<em>You can always easily upgrade the Foundation version. Especially if you are using the Sass version of the theme, which has Bower support.Â </em>
<h4>Who do you recommend for hosting?</h4>
I recently made the switch to <a href="http://bit.ly/host-wpengine" target="_blank">WP Engine</a> and couldn't be happier. All of their packages include automatic daily backups, a no-hack guarantee, awesome support and much more. The best part was probably the noticeable speed improvements I saw - even on small websites. JointsWP.com runs 2.5x faster on WP Engine than it did with my previous host.

They'll even tell you <a href="http://bit.ly/wpengine-speed">why your website is slow (and what you can do about it) - for free!</a>
<h4>Does JointsWP work with Gravity Forms?</h4>
Yes! In fact, it works very well. You can see how to <a href="http://jointswp.com/demo/gravity-forms/">setup Gravity Forms to use Foundation 5 Form Styling here</a>.
<h4>What license does JointsWP use?</h4>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html" target="_blank">GNU General Public License</a> &amp; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License" target="_blank">MIT</a>.

Confused yet?

All JointsWP and WordPress functions and styles are under the GPL license. All Foundation components fall under the MIT license.
