JointsWP is meant to be a starting point for WordPress themes. It's designed to be heavily customized for whatever your specific project needs. This makes offering support for JointsWP extremely difficult - especially after heavy modifications.

If you find a bug or something that just doesn't seem right, I encourage you to report it as an "Issue" in the GitHup repo (<a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP">Sass Link</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP-CSS">CSS Link</a>).
<h3>Other Support Resources</h3>
<ul>
	<li><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/forum" target="_blank">Foundation Forum</a> - tag your posts with "JointsWP"</li>
	<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> - tag your posts with "JointsWP"</li>
	<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/support/" target="_blank">WordPress Support Forum</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Paid Support</h3>
If you need urgent support or heavy modifications performed, paid support is offered on a case-by-case basis. Please contact me at jeremy@theadgarage.com.
