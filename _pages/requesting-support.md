JointsWP is meant to be a starting point for WordPress themes. It's designed to be heavily customized for whatever your specific project needs. This makes offering support for JointsWP extremely difficult - especially after heavy modifications.

If you find a bug or something that just doesn't seem right, I encourage you to report it as an "Issue" in the GitHup repo (<a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP">Sass Link</a>, <a href="https://github.com/JeremyEnglert/JointsWP-CSS">CSS Link</a>).

Note: As of January 2017, we are requesting that all support / questions / issues be posted to GitHub. Comments have been turned off on documentation pages.
