If you're using the Sass version of the theme, I'm going to assume you know how to install a WordPress theme. If you need a quick reminder, check out the JointsWP-CSS install instructions - the installation process is the same.
<h3>Sass File Structure Overview</h3>
All of the Sass files can be found in the <code>assets/sass</code> directory. The theme enqueues the <code>assets/css/styles.min.css</code> file for styles.

The Foundation files are imported from the <code>vendor</code> directory, but don't make changes to those files, as they will be overwritten if you ever update Foundation.
