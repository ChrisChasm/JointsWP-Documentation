<h3 class="alert-box">About These Docs</h3>
JointsWP is a blank WordPress theme built that includes all of the power of <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation 6</a>. To learn more about specific Foundation components, check out the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/" target="_blank">Foundation 6 Documentation</a>.

The documentation laid out on this site will cover how to get started with JointsWP and how some Foundation components, such as off-canvas components and menus, are integrated with WordPress.

<h3>What comes with JointsWP?</h3>
JointsWP comes pre-baked with all of the great features that are found in the Foundation framework - simply put, if it works in Foundation, it will work in JointsWP. The theme also includes:
<ul>
	<li>Sass or CSS Versions</li>
	<li>Multiple Foundation Navigation Options</li>
	<li>Motion-UI Support</li>
	<li>Grid  Archive Template</li>
	<li>Translation Support</li>
	<li>Bower and Gulp Support</li>
	<li>And much, much more!</li>
</ul>

<h4>What tools do I need to use JointsWP?</h4>
You can use whatever you want - seriously. You can use CodeKit, Grunt, Compass or nothing at all. It's completely up to you how you decide to build your theme - JointsWP won't get in the way of your workflow.

The Sass version of the theme does include Gulp and is optimized for a <a href="http://jointswp.com/docs/gulp/">Gulp-based workflow</a>. To get the most out of JointsWP and Foundation, Gulp is highly recommended.
