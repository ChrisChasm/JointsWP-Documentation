<a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/flex-video.html">Flex Video</a> is an awesome feature found in Foundation that allows for the use of responsive video embeds from websites like YouTube and Vimeo.

Using WordPress, you can simply paste a video link into the visual editor and it will <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">automatically embed</a> the video.

JointsWP will automatically wrap all YouTube and Vimeo embeds with a flex video wrapper.

This function can be found in the <code>assets/js/scripts.js</code> file. If you're using Gulp, it can be found in the <code>assets/js/scripts/wp-foundation.js</code>Â file.
